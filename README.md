Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

My motivation for this project was to create a quiz that could test the knowledge of bootcamp students and measure their progress throughout the course.

The quiz I built consists of five questions and a 60-second timer that ends the quiz when it reaches zero. If a student selects the wrong answer, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer.

I also wanted the system to display the top five highest scores along with the students' initials to help compare their progress with that of other bootcamp students.

During the development of this project, I was able to practice various skills such as event listeners, setting APIs, timer functions, and JSON functions. However, I faced some challenges while working on this project, such as displaying the questions and end pages, which did not have their own HTML files. To overcome this, I learned to use the "hide" class to change pages within a single HTML file.

Additionally, I encountered an issue with the timer starting before the quiz, which required me to modify my code. At one point, the answer choices were not displaying under the questions, and throughout the challenge, managing three JS files and two HTML files was challenging, and I found myself getting muddled up a few times.

Acceptance Criteria
Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.

Questions contain buttons for each answer.
When answer is clicked, the next question appears
If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
